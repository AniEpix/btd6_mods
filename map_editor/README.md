use F1 or F2 and click on the map (in-game) to generate code (it will be in map.txt)

F1 generates tracks by clicking

F2 generates areas by drawing polygons, before you use it press keys 0,1 or 2 to select the type of area

When you start, use placeholder data from another map so you can load your new custom map into the game and draw the points
